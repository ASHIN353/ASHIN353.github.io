                <p>Born in Tennessee in 1963, Quentin Tarantino moved to California at age 4.<br> 
                    His love of movies led to a job in a video store, during which time he wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born Killers..<br>  
                    Tarantino's directorial debut came with 1992's Reservoir Dogs, but he received widespread critical and commercial acclaim with Pulp Fiction (1994),.<br>  
                    for which he won an Academy Award for best screenplay. Subsequent features included Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007)..<br>  
                    Tarantino earned several award nominations for Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the latter garnering him a second Oscar win for best screenplay,.<br>  
                    and he went on to write and direct The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood (2019)..<br>
